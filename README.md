# Serious-SQL
This repository will be used to highlight the important takeaways from Danny's Serious SQL courses. Every week, I will sumarise the topics I will learnt here and also attempt the case studies posted in the 8weeksqlchallenge.
On the 11th of September 2021, I learnt the analytic functions also call window function in SQL. They include; 1.The aggregates functions such as AVG, SUM and COUNT. They process all rows in the frame.
2. Ordered functions which include row_number, rank and Dense_rank functions. The third group include Lead, lag, Ntile, percent_rank, cum_dist, first_value, Last_value
3. Row access: acess rows by absolute or relative position from ordered frame or partition e.g first/last/nth.
